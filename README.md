1.The user must rapidly touch the screen in order to increase the bird sprites (pink box) height. Not touching the screen has the opposite 
effect, within the dimensions of the game window.

2.The goal of the game is to manouvre the bird to collect the small blue orbs, whilst at the same time avoiding the larger black orbs 
(red circles). The blue orbs award the player with 10 points, whilst the black orbs cost the player one life.

3. The user can see their score, level and lifes at the top of the screen (green rectangle).

4. Everytime a specific points milestone is reached, the level increases. With a level increase comes a subsequent increase in the speed
of the black orbs. The max level a user can achieve is level 5, at which point the "Level 4" text turns into "MAX LEVEL".

If the user runs out of lives, they are directed to the death screen where they will have the option to click the "Try Again" button to have
another go.
